The dataset of the communication satellite range scheduling problem
The communication satellite range scheduling problem (CSRSP) is indispensable for the regular operation of the low earth orbit internet constellation, which involves scheduling tracking telemetry and command (TT&C) tasks within their executable arcs to maximize the profit from these scheduled tasks. Different from traditional SRSP, the inter-satellite links are taken into account in CSRSP to facilitate the rapid completion of TT&C tasks. Moreover, the increasing number of satellites and the emergence of associated diverse types of TT&C tasks further escalate the complexity of this problem.
